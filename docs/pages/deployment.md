# Deployment
{: .fs-9 }

Here, you can find a detailed guide on how to configure and deploy the Dataspace Connector.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

---

This section gives information about the [configuration](deployment/configuration.md) and
[building](deployment/build.md) of the Dataspace Connector. **Please make sure that you get familiar
with at least these two subpages.** After that, you may want to have a look at the
[Communication Guide](communication.md) and see how to provide and consume data with our IDS
Connector implementation. Further information about database and logging adjustments, a
Kubernetes-specific deployment, or one with a data routing framework is provided on the other pages.
