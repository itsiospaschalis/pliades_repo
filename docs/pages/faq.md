Since the Dataspace Connector is continuously being optimized and extended, it is not possible to
provide a comprehensive list at this location. GitHub comes with the functionalities to create
Issues and Discussions to facilitate a transparent development and exchange. Feel free to check out
the corresponding pages and see if your questions have already been answered. If not, please feel
free to open a new thread, so the community can help you.

## Still using an old version?

Since we do not support old versions, our documentation refers only to the latest version of the
Dataspace Connector. Nevertheless, the **documentation for version 4.x.x**, that was previously
located in the GitHub [wiki](https://github.com/International-Data-Spaces-Association/DataspaceConnector/wiki),
can be downloaded [here](assets/files/dsc_v4_wiki.zip). The [communication section](communication/v5.md)
provides information about version 5.
